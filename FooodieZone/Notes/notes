1. JSX is needed to get rid of the clumsy code of react.createElement, using react.createElement makes a mess 
to read the code, it is not developer friendly at all.

2. JSX is NOT html inside Javascript, JSX is html like syntax. 

3. JSX is just a syntax react element is an object

4. If we write const jsxHeading = <h1 id='heading'> This heading is using JSX</h1> in browser it will not understand this piece of
code because this is not a javascript code, but this code is getting transpiled by Parcel before it goes to the JS engine
then JS engine receive the code that browsers can unbderstand.

5. Does Parcel itself is responsible for the transpikation? -> NO Parcel uses BABEL (normal JS package in node modules)
for the transpilation

6. The JSX provided is converted into React.createElement (object) by babel and then it is converted into HTML element (render)
READ BABEL DOCUMENTATION

7. if u need to give attributes in JSX it is given in JSX EXPLORE ALL KIND OF ATTRIBUTES 

8. if you are writing JSX in single line it if valid, but if you want to write multiple lines then it needs to get
wrapped inside brackets (). 

9. Component is the Javascript function returning JSX, it is the smallest piece of code.

10. any JS code can beadded into compoent using {}

11. Read about cross scripting attack -> what ever code is passes inside the {} in JSX first it is sanitized by JSX
and then it runs.
